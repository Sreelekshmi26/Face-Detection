# Face-Detection
Face detection is one of the most used applications of computer vision. Using this technique the computer will be able to detect human face.
Use:
This technique is widely used by government and organization across the world for surveillance and policing and many more uses cases.
We are also making the uses in daily life such as the face unlocking of our smartphone!

A facial detection system is a technology capable of detecting a human face from digital image or a video. To find the face, the image can be searched for landmarks such as the eyes and nose.
I have developed this face detection model using Python. The Single Shot Detector, frontal face algorithm HaarCascade and the Face Recognition is used to identify the faces in a picture.
